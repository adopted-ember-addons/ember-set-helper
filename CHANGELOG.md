## v1.0.0 (2020-07-11)

Placeholder syntax has been removed in this major release. It was experimental,
and the finding was that it couldn't be generalized in a way that would make
sense in the Handlebars language. Removing it brings this addon more inline with
the future of the language as a whole.

The API has been simplified, and documentation has been updated to reflect the
new API without placeholder syntax.
